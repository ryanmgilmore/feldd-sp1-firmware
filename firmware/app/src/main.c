/*
 * SP-1 controller firmware — main.
 *
 * Boot contract (the SP-1 "BIG FIVE"): app lives at 0x20000; watchdog fed
 * < 5 s; we do NOT re-init bootloader-owned clocks/peripherals; SYSTEM_OFF on a
 * •• hold returns to the bootloader; RESETREAS is cleared on boot and before
 * SYSTEM_OFF. (There is no hardware reset pin on the SP-1, so a clean path back
 * to the bootloader is mandatory.)
 *
 * M2.2 adds: SAADC read of the 4 faders + 2 button ladders + battery
 * (controls.c) and a USB-CDC console (device_next stack via the sample_usbd
 * helper).
 * M4.1 adds: USB-MIDI 1.0 (hand-rolled usb_midi1.c class) to the same composite
 * as the CDC console (both ride one usbd context, brought up by usbdev_start),
 * and a USB sink in midi_out so the mapping engine emits to BOTH the TRS UART
 * and USB-MIDI.
 * M6.2 adds: the CDC console is now the JSON-lines config protocol channel
 * (config_cdc.c wraps the librarian as a proto_store for protocol.c) plus a
 * live monitor stream of fader CCs / button edges. The old per-loop raw-ADC and
 * per-event MIDI/BTN debug printk chatter is removed so the port is a clean
 * structured stream for the web config tool.
 * HARDWARE VERIFICATION DEFERRED: no SAADC/USBD model in Renode and Unit A is
 * not available, so this is BUILD-VERIFIED only — the live fader read, the TRS
 * electrical bench-test, and USB-MIDI computer-enumeration are checked when
 * Unit A is on the bench.
