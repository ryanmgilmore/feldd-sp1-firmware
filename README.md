# feldd, with per-profile TRS output and Bluetooth MIDI thru

This is a fork of [feldd](https://github.com/bnjreece/feldd-sp1-firmware) by
Benjamin Reece. It carries changes offered upstream as separate pull requests,
merged here so they can be used now:

| Change | Upstream PR |
|---|---|
| Selectable TRS jack: MIDI out, analog trigger, or analog sync | #4 |
| Profile migration: a format bump keeps your profiles | [link] |
| TRS jack settings per profile (profile v10) | [link] |
| MIDI thru USB → Bluetooth, on its own switch | [link] |
| A bump on •• no longer powers the SP-1 on (1.5 s hold) | [link] |
| Public tree builds without the Bluetooth sources | #2 |

**Download:** [Releases](../../releases) — the `.bin` includes Bluetooth MIDI.
**Configure:** [the configurator](https://ryanmgilmore.github.io/feldd-sp1-firmware/)
— required for this firmware; see below.

## Installing

1. If your SP-1 has never run feldd's own release build, flash that first and use
   feldd.com's configurator to **enable Bluetooth** — only feldd's build can
   provision the radio.
2. Flash this fork's `.bin` from Releases, the same way.
3. Configure it **only with this fork's configurator.** feldd.com's configurator
   does not understand profile v10: it reads these profiles wrongly, and saving
   from it would overwrite them.

Your existing profiles are migrated on first boot, not erased.

## Building

Built exactly as upstream (below). The source here builds **without** Bluetooth,
like upstream's public tree; the released `.bin` adds a Bluetooth driver that is
not published. [Ryan: wording.]

![feldd, browser-configurable controller firmware for the Teenage Engineering SP-1](docs/feldd-og.png)

**feldd turns the Teenage Engineering SP-1 into a configurable MIDI and keyboard controller. Its 4 faders and 9 buttons become fully remappable over USB and 3.5 mm TRS MIDI, set up entirely from your browser.**

> The SP-1 is an unreleased TE device. This is unofficial community firmware, not affiliated with or endorsed by Teenage Engineering.

**Latest firmware: v0.27.3 (stable)** (get it at [feldd.com](https://feldd.com)). Beta in soak: **v0.28.0-beta** &mdash; MIDI thru (forward USB-in MIDI out the 3.5mm TRS jack, a USB-to-TRS bridge), on the `?beta=1` link.

**New in 0.27:** Bluetooth. feldd reprograms the SP-1's built-in radio, in place from the browser, into a wireless BLE-MIDI controller and a Bluetooth keyboard, turn it on with •• + PLAY and pair with a phone, laptop, or iPad, no cable. (0.24 added MIDI clock; PLAY is a normal mappable button.)

## What it does

- 🎛️ **4 faders + 9 buttons → MIDI**, map any control to any CC or note, each on its own channel; a button can also send a value you pick (set-on-press, momentary, or toggle)
- ⌨️ **Keyboard mode**, buttons can type keys and shortcuts (Cmd+C, Cmd+Z) so it drives any app, not just music software
- 🎵 **Chords + note-sets on any button**, build a chord per button as a hand-picked set, a root and quality, or a range for an M8 cluster, one press fires the whole set
- 🪜 **8 layers per profile**, hold PLAY to shift to a layer you pick (the side light follows), or flip PLAY to a normal mappable button
- 💾 **8 profiles per mode on the device**, step them live with •• + Vol, no computer needed
- 🎚️ **•• is the function button**, hold it and tap a control to step layers or profiles, flip MIDI/Keyboard mode, or reach the utility row (battery, LED brightness, MIDI panic); hold •• to peek your profile
- 🏷️ **Name your controls**, per-control labels save with your .feldd file so a shared profile explains itself
- 🎹 **USB-MIDI 1.0 + TRS (3.5 mm) MIDI** out, drives your DAW or your hardware
- 📶 **Wireless Bluetooth (BLE-MIDI + keyboard)**, feldd reprograms the SP-1's onboard radio from the browser so it pairs with a phone, laptop, or iPad with no cable (0.27+)
- 🔌 **Configure live in the browser**, read, edit, write, and watch your controls move in real time over USB

## Use it, all in the browser, no app to install

### → **[feldd.com](https://feldd.com)**

- **[Configure your SP-1](https://feldd.com/sp-1/configure)**, map the faders + buttons, manage your 8 profiles, and watch them fire live. *(Chromium browser, uses WebSerial.)*
- **[Flash the firmware](https://feldd.com/sp-1/flash)**, a guided walkthrough using the community **Solderless** tool.

Flash once, then configure and reconfigure from the browser whenever you like.

## What's not in this repo

feldd's **Bluetooth radio firmware is deliberately not open-sourced here.** Getting the SP-1's
onboard radio (a Cypress/Infineon CYW20706) to speak Bluetooth means loading a compiled radio image
onto it, and that image plus the vendor's download minidriver are **not ours to redistribute as
source.** So the following are intentionally omitted from this tree:

- `firmware/app/src/cybt_blobs.h` — the CYW20706 payloads (the vendor download minidriver + our
  compiled BLE-MIDI app image for the radio). Vendor-derived binaries, not our source to publish.
- `firmware/app/src/bt_provision.*`, `bt_download.*`, `bt_probe.*` and the rest of the radio-flashing
  subsystem, which embeds and depends on that image.
- The Bluetooth build overlays and their host tests.

The controller firmware in this repo builds and runs completely without any of that. The Bluetooth
feature itself is **fully written up** in [`bluetooth/`](bluetooth) (architecture, how the reflash
works, findings), and the **flashable Bluetooth build** — the one that includes the radio image — is
the public download at [feldd.com](https://feldd.com). A few build files (`CMakeLists.txt`, `Kconfig`,
`config_cdc.c`) still carry the conditional hooks that reference the omitted sources; they compile out
by default.

## 🤖 Claude Code console (feldd-cc)

Turn the SP-1 into a physical console for **Claude Code**: the track lights show when an agent is
working / needs you / done, and the buttons drive the session (Play = approve, rocker = scroll). It's
a small local daemon plus Claude Code hooks, talking to feldd's `led` verb (shipped in 0.16.0-beta)
and its button monitor stream over USB. Setup is itself a Claude Code task — point your agent at
[`feldd-cc/`](feldd-cc) and have it follow [`feldd-cc/SETUP.md`](feldd-cc/SETUP.md). The led verb +
monitor stream are hardware-validated.

## ⚠️ Flashing safety

You're modifying an irreplaceable device. feldd links above the TE bootloader (`0x20000`) and keeps the Track 1 + 4 DFU escape hatch plus a charge-standby gate, so a bad flash is recoverable by re-flashing the known-good `sp1_looper.bin`. Read the warnings on the [flash page](https://feldd.com/sp-1/flash) before you start.

## Building from source

> Most people never need this, just use **[feldd.com](https://feldd.com)**. This section is for developers who want to build or fork the firmware.

feldd is a Zephyr / nRF Connect SDK app for the nRF52840 inside the SP-1.

- Set up the toolchain + west workspace: `scripts/setup-zephyr-ws.sh`
- Get the **`sp1` board definition** from the **marisko** project and point `BOARD_ROOT` (in `scripts/fw.sh`) at it
- Build: `scripts/fw.sh build` · flashable image: `scripts/fw.sh bin` · vector-table/size check: `scripts/fw.sh info`
- `scripts/sp1ctl.py`, host CLI for the JSON-lines config protocol; `firmware/test/`, pure-logic tests (`cd firmware/test && make`)
- Protocol + packed profile format: `scripts/sp1-profile-format.md`
